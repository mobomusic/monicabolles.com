I have been thinking a lot the concept of time and the ways in which we perceive time in relationship to storytelling.  I have become recently inspired by hypertext electronic literature and the ways in which it breaks down the normal conception of how we tell stories in a linear fashion.  Hypertext is somewhat the choose your own adventure model; however, in many of the pieces I have been reading it becomes much more personal than that.  In Shelly Jackson’s My Body there is intimacy to the way the story reads.  It’s almost like you are within her mind and her thoughts.  You can travel through her thinking in a way that traditional timelines don’t allow.  How may I tell this story of Resonance seen through different lenses in a way where the timeline is broken apart, rewound, paused, and fast-forwarded? In our digital space we can do things with time that is impossible to do in our physical environment.  How can I use the digital space to manipulate the timelines within my story?
