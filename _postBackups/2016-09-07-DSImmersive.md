When I was little I used to wake up to hearing someone playing piano.  I would walk downstairs and nobody would be there.  I have always heard melodies constantly playing in my mind.  I have always seen vivid visual images.  I have always wanted to get them out of mind.  These experiences for me feel very immersive.  If I close my eyes I can see and hear things to the point I feel the experience all over my body.  I have always wanted to share this feeling with other people.
