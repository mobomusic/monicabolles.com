Through this process I am recognizing themes that are arising.  One word that I am feeling particularly keen towards is “Lens”.  In going through this process of looking at a particular subject from the perspectives of different people within certain disciplines, I have found myself using the word “lens” to describe those perspectives.  I am beginning to question how can I visualize and/or sonify this experience of looking at the concept of resonance through different lenses?  What would those lenses look like?  What would they be?
