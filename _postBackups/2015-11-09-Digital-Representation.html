    <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
    
    <p>As I dive further into learning what I can about manipulating 3D models of images that I have scanned using my Kinect 360 in Max MSP, I question what it is that drives us to attempt to recreate reality in a space in which we can manipulate and distort its truth.  Is our reality so bad that we need to find any way to escape from it?  Or is it just the pureness of our human curiosity that pulls us into this virtual existence we've built out of a binary system of ideals?  There is a love, addiction, and hate that society seems to have for these technical "achievements" that have been wrapped up in pretty design.  It is in this space we can create whatever world we can imagine.  We can become whomever we want.  Are we becoming digital people?</p>
