Objective: 

To contemplate the theory of resonance through the integration of physics, psychology, art, and music in an interactive multimedia performance piece accompanied by an interactive hypertext novel.  


Method:  Hypertext

For the written presentation of my work I will create a hypertext that explores my thought process as well as the meetings and interactions that define the core moments of my research.  The hypertext will host written reflections on interviews, readings, and experiments as well as audio, video clips, and illustrations.  This method is meant to explore the relationships and connections that form between thoughts, conversations, and experiences during the research and creation process.
