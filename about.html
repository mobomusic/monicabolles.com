		<p>As an artist, I design and produce experiences that immerse the audience in sonic, visual, and tactile sensation.  I question relationships, explore communication, and foster interaction.  I believe people connect with the world around them through experiences, so I create experiences that immerse their senses and offer them new insights into somewhat abstract concepts.</p> 

		<p>As an audio engineer/composer I combine my love of science and art to explore space and the ways in which space can be used to create new tonalities and new compositional practices.  Through working with a variety of immersive sound formats, developing new recording techniques, and building new tools I question how adding a third dimension to musical practice can alter the creation process at the same time influence the listener to connect to sound in new ways.</p>   

		<p>In art, sound, and in life, I experience, research, and learn.  I believe that an artistic practice is a practice of exploration, experimentation, research, and discovery.  It is not just about the output, but also about the journey we take to reach that output.  The artistic process reveals insights into our subjective connection to nature and offers input on the influences of humanity.  While science teaches us to look at nature as objectively and methodically as possible, art encourages us to place the human in the middle of the equation and be fully subject.  While artistic thought may not be ‘methodically’ proven, it should be valued as a valid argument for world discovery and understanding.
