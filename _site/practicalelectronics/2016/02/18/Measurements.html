    <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
    
    <p>Being able to measure and test your signals becomes super useful in helping troubleshoot and figure out what is wrong with your project.  Wayne Seltzer stepped in to help us go over measuring signals and discussing the different kinds of techniques used to analalyze and test your signal.</p>

    <p>Multimeters are your friend!  Probably the most useful function of a multimeter is measuring continuity.  This function allows you to tell if your two points are connected.  If they are not connected then there is obviously something wrong with your circuit.  Multimeters can also measure resistance, voltage, and current!</p>

    <p>The other fun and awesome measurement tool is the Oscilliscope.  We took out this four channel oscilliscope and decided to use it to view the current coming out of the wall.  This is not something I recommend anyone to do that doesn't have someone who knows what they are doing with them.</p> 

    <p>Wayne had brought what he called a "suicide chord" in for show and tell.  This was just a plug with the ends cut off.  We hooked it up to a transformer and then measured the signal off of that.  The AC current out of the wall creates a beautiful sine wave.  We then added a capacitor into the equation and it caused the tops of the waves to get cut off.</p>  

    <p>It is very interesting being able to visualize what is happening with a signal when you add different electrical components to it.  Being able to see the actual wave helps in understanding what is actually happening when you are adding components together.</p>
